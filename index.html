    <h2>Week 1: What You Know</h2>
    <p class="source"><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/118984/how-can-you-program-if-youre-blind">Reading: <em>Stack Overflow: How can you program if you're blind</em></a></p>
    <p>Jonathan Chacón makes one of the more powerful points in this thread when he talks about how it seems that people think more easily about accessibility with respect to end-users but they don’t think about accessibility as a partner and co-developer in the final project. I think that’s a salient point that ought to inform a lot of web development projects. An MVP that is not accessible is simply not an MVP by definition.</p>
    <p>It is besides the point here but interesting to me as a chronic historian—a condition without a cure, truly—that we are slowly arriving at a phase of human history where digital ephemera like webpages, message boards, and other threads, like this question thread on Stack Overflow, feel as if they are part of a cultural heritage that ought to be preserved. It has often been gestured that Fukuyama’s <em>End of History</em>, while not true as an assessment of the state of the world, certainly has power as an ideology, a yearning for a present without memory. An analogy to me would be how problematic it is to adequately develop a history of web design due to the demise of Geocities—or how inadequate a history of social networking would be without a discussion of MySpace and yet how inadequate any attempt to summarize the often modular design of MySpace would be in 2019 and beyond. For a more in-depth exploration on the struggle to capture a history of web design and to archive Geocities, check out “404 Page Not Found” by Kate Wagner: <a href="https://thebaffler.com/salvos/404-page-not-found-wagner">click here to read the article.</a></p>

    <h2>Week 0: Against Normal</h2>
    <p class="source"><a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/on-average/">Reading: <em>On Average</em> by Avery Trufelman</a></p>
    <p>I don’t know if it’s the humanities or what but whenever yet I am basically always suspicious when I hear an appeal to what’s normal. The range and variety of human experience does not conform to the average. ‘Normal’ is a lie, a fable, and the truth of the first cockpits, designed to accommodate the average man, is that the application of what is normal harms and degrades. We might not perceive it that way, but it is so: to bring ‘normal’ to bear on someone or something is to knowingly or unknowingly bludgeon someone outside of the edges and irregularities that make them themselves. </p>
    <p>The story here is also about the misapplication and misunderstanding of statistics and what they claim and what they do not. Quetelet’s application of statistics to social studies is of its time and has yielded many trenchant insights in that field. Statistics make for good performance indicators and can aid analysis, bringing it beyond interpretive faculties that are no more than one guy’s perception of what’s what. However, to apply an average to a world that is irregular, misshapen, and unique misunderstands a descriptive analytic for a predictive one. </p>
    <p>The smarter question asks what arrangements are predictive of success, what designs and organizations are statistically likely to yield successes, and so on. If in usability testing there are a lot of ratings, on scales from 1-5, then that’s probably why. Numbers can be approachable and easily grasped in a way that words and sentences might not.</p>
    <p>I give the article an 8/10.</p>
