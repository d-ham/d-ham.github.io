    <h2>Week 0: Against Normal</h2>
    <p class="source"><a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/on-average/">Reading: <em>On Average</em> by Avery Trufelman</a></p>
    <p>I don’t know if it’s the humanities or what but whenever yet I am basically always suspicious when I hear an appeal to what’s normal. The range and variety of human experience does not conform to the average. ‘Normal’ is a lie, a fable, and the truth of the first cockpits, designed to accommodate the average man, is that the application of what is normal harms and degrades. We might not perceive it that way, but it is so: to bring ‘normal’ to bear on someone or something is to knowingly or unknowingly bludgeon someone outside of the edges and irregularities that make them themselves. </p>
    <p>The story here is also about the misapplication and misunderstanding of statistics and what they claim and what they do not. Quetelet’s application of statistics to social studies is of its time and has yielded many trenchant insights in that field. Statistics make for good performance indicators and can aid analysis, bringing it beyond interpretive faculties that are no more than one guy’s perception of what’s what. However, to apply an average to a world that is irregular, misshapen, and unique misunderstands a descriptive analytic for a predictive one. </p>
    <p>The smarter question asks what arrangements are predictive of success, what designs and organizations are statistically likely to yield successes, and so on. If in usability testing there are a lot of ratings, on scales from 1-5, then that’s probably why. Numbers can be approachable and easily grasped in a way that words and sentences might not.</p>
    <p>I give the article an 8/10.</p>
