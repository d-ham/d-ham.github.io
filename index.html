    <h2>Week 6: How to Write a Story</h2>
    <p class="source"><a href="https://channel101.fandom.com/wiki/Story_Structure_104:_The_Juicy_Details">Reading: <em>The Juicy Details</em> by Dan Harmon</a></p>
    <p>One of my favourite things to do is read writers give advice about writing. It’s a little, unheralded genre of essay perfect if you’re like me and you want to squirrel away banal minutiae about art and artists all day. Notably, there are some listicles. Robert Bolaño wrote an essay about how to write short stories that devolves into an enumerated list full of compulsive namedropping framed by imperatives to <em>read basically everyone</em>. Margaret Atwood says writing is work and recommends back exercises.  Langston Hughes wrote ten easy tips on how to become a bad writer. George Orwell in <a href=”http://srjcstaff.santarosa.edu/~mheydon/whywriteD.pdf“>“Why I Write”</a> lists “sheer egoism” as the first of four reasons for a writer to want to write.</p>
    <p>All this is to say that process writing is hard, even with you split it into steps. So it goes with a good test case. Part of it is that you don’t know the blind spots in your work until someone who knows no better is brought face to face with the product and the test case you wrote and asked to make something of it. It is a special danger for a junior web developer. Thomas Pynchon writes in his self-deprecating introduction to <em>Slow Learner</em> that “[t]he trouble with many of us is that the earlier stages of life we are often unaware of the scope and structure of our ignorance. Ignorance is not just a blank space on a person's mental map. It has contours and coherence, and for all I know rules of operation as well. So as a corollary to writing about what we know, maybe we should add getting familiar with our ignorance, and the possibilities therein for ruining a good story.”</p>
    <p>Borrowing still from the world of letters, you must make a tester want something, even if it’s trivial. Kurt Vonnegut once said the following in <a href=”https://books.google.ca/books?id=bLQeOR_m2YMC&lpg=PA189&ots=FfI9sdNc7q&pg=PA189#v=onepage&q&f=false”>an interview</a>: “When I used to teach creative writing, I would tell students to make their characters want something right away — even if it's only a glass of water. Characters paralyzed by the meaninglessness of modern life still have to drink water from time to time.</p>
    <p>“One of my students wrote a story about a nun who got a piece of dental floss stuck between her lower left molars, and who couldn't get it out all day long. I thought that was wonderful. The story dealt with issues a lot more important than dental floss, but what kept readers going was anxiety about when the dental floss would finally be removed. Nobody could read that story without fishing around in his mouth with a finger.”</p>
    <p>Much like with a good test case, you want to give the activity a narrative and make your tester want something. Anything. If so, we might think to what William Butler Yeats wrote once in <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=nZQVmtbzFPYC&lpg=PT370&ots=OtQGCzsMQp&pg=PT370#v=onepage&q&f=false">his journal</a>: “A good writer should be so simple that he has no faults, only sins.” So it is with unit testing. The sins of the program should shine through.</p>

    <h2>Week 5: Melissa, ILOVEYOU, and Other Childhood Friends</h2>
    <p class="source"><a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/gander-housed-stranded-passengers/">Reading: <em>Take a Gander</em> from Snopes</a></p>
    <p>When I was young, I was very into computer viruses. This meant I spent a lot of time reading Norton Antivirus updates, reading A-Z encyclopedia of viruses, Adware, and Trojan horses deep in the file directory of the program. I would pore over updates and scan my computers constantly. Eventually my relatives would inevitably get something on their computer—some kind of program from some post-Soviet state that would nag them for their credit card number to “clean” their computer. It would be up to me to stop the offending scripts, clean up the registry, and delete whatever contaminated files caused this issue. This was back when Windows 95 was still in vogue and websites could still format your hard drive with JavaScript and PHP. You know, the good old days.</p>
    <p>An ally in my childlike crusade against malicious viruses and general fascination with their cycles, payloads, etc. were websites like this one, Snopes. Skeptic debunker websites were very much in vogue in the late ‘90s and early 2000s, and it is thanks to them that <a href="http://nietzsche.holtof.com/Nietzsche_ecce_homo/eh2.html">I am so clever</a> today. Snopes and others were an early mass of websites that debunked chain mail (when that was still a thing), various hysterical reports that included viruses, and paranormal pseudo-science stuff. The skeptic movement splintered off later in the 2000s to encompass more libertarian and more neo-conservative views, and I was more intensely in puberty and found less joy in being an annoying and sneering know-it-all. <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=DL4RL2XeAdsC&lpg=PT237&dq=mason%20%26%20dixon%20page%20350&pg=PT237#v=onepage&q&f=false">Who claims truth, truth abandons</a> as they say. I didn’t understand it in those terms at the time but I fell off the wagon at that point. Viruses are still cool, though.</p>
    <p>Anyway, all this is to say I don’t understand what the events that inspired <em>Come from Away</em> have to do with usability and accessibility. Maybe it’s like, oh, imagine in an emergency what would happen if what you had wasn’t usable, or it is only by the generosity of people towards others they do not know that the world turns. But that seemed tenuous so I wrote about being a kid obsessed with viruses and Snopes instead.</p>

    <h2>Week 4: Beans</h2>
    <p class="source"><a href="https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey7/">Reading: <em>Screen Reader User Survey #7 Results</em></a></p>
    <p>A salient truth that comes through from this report is that people with visual disabilities have always been internet users. It doesn’t make sense to Other them or diminish in some way their digital interactions because so much of their trends mimic the general trend of the enfranchised, online population. They have trended toward more mobile use, such that mobile and desktop use are basically the same, and are therefore just as focused on responsiveness as people without visual impairments.</p>
    <p>It’s interesting that the overwhelming majority—85.3% to be exact—of them consider the main impediment for them to be poor web development practices that turn out non-accessible websites rather than any issue with screenreader technology. Progress is slow: only 40.8% of respondents perceive any progress whatsoever with respect to accessibility practices, and a solid fraction of them feel things have even gotten worse.</p>
    <p>Based on their feedback here, it’s pretty clear that semantic programming does a lot to streamline accessibility for these people. 67.5% of respondents focus on headings and 14.4% use the Find features they have, meaning over 4/5s of people use their devices to essentially traverse the DOM to find what they need. The proliferation of CAPTCHAs and inconsistent implementation of things like Skip links are also a part of the feedback. </p>
    <p>I don’t feel like I didn’t already know some of this but it’s interesting to see it all laid bare like this.</p>

    <h2>Week 3: It Ain't Easy</h2>
    <p class="source"><a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_curb_cut_effect">Reading: <em>The Curb-Cut Effect</em></a> by Angela Glover Blackwell</p>
    <p>This article very thoroughly and diplomatically makes clear the central thesis of post-war state-expansionist capitalist politics: the expansion of state services towards a wider population increases participation in the economy, which drives economic activity. That’s maybe an aggressive way of looking at things, but it’s really axis on which liberal progressivism joins forces with left-wing agitation in order to attempt to convince the capitalist class that these kinds of changes are in its self-interest.</p>
    <p>That convincing is a more theoretical dynamic than an actual one, as one is frequently made breathless from the  work of convincing and reconvincing the Gordon Gekkos of the world that it could be in their self-interest to expand accessibility efforts. It gets presumptuous to read the negotiating, deal-brokering language about it after a while, and this article can sometimes be a bit presumptuous about how much this convincing has been done or about how equitable these improvements are. Take, for instance, the discussion of bike lanes. This debate is not settled in places like Toronto, where public debates about bike lanes have been around for basically my entire adult life.</p>
    <p>Moreover, if adding bike lanes causes the property values to spike dramatically, it’s arguable that one form of accessibility is coming at the cost of another without a pronounced, sustained city planning effort that can reinvent the accessibility standards of a city physically, linguistically, and economically. As I get older and crankier, I am more and more drawn to a radical and uncompromising vision for this kind of social progress that makes no attempts at compromises or deals.</p>
    <p>As a citizen of Toronto, I may perhaps be projecting.</p>

    <h2>Week 2: The Old Online</h2>
    <p class="source"><a href="http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/2012/03/21/why-vim/">Reading: <em>Why Vim?</em></a></p>
    <p>From content to tone to the web design, this article feels like a throwback to an older internet and older digital experience. The “women will be totally like ‘I want to have his babies!’” would have been cringe-inducing in 2012 and in 2019 is so embarrassing as to almost undermine his argument. I never hear “n00b” anymore except in an ironic, atavistic sense, evocative of an older age of online, when “All your base is belong to us” was legitimately hilarious. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ytmnd-youre-the-man-now-dog-shuts-down/">All those moments, lost in time, tears in rain, time to die, and so on</a>.</p>
    <p>Given this is a class about accessibility, one impression I had from the article is how relative accessibility and usability are as concepts. The perspective of the article is that of a seasoned veteran, and it makes me appreciate how the passion of the community around web development has tended to want to make things clearer and easier, which has served to radically simplify the process of getting into web development. Many complicated processes are simplified by means of community-developed packages accessible through package managers like Composer, npm, or pip. Vim wears its complexity as a consequence of its history, which the article covers in a very interesting way. Less interesting, of course, is the gatekeeping tone that runs through the article. There’s no reason for web development to be more complex than it already can be.</p>
    <p>But a lot of that is just my impression and belies how much I don’t know about what lies ahead. As my web development experience grows and matures, maybe Vim will become not only an editor I work with on a regular basis but the editor I prefer. I tend to like complex things that are pockmarked by stories from the past. I read and enjoyed <em>Ulysses</em>. I am currently reading <em>Feudalism</em> by François Louis Ganshof, which is very out-of-date but compensates by being dry and uninteresting.</p>

    <h2>Week 1: What You Know</h2>
    <p class="source"><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/118984/how-can-you-program-if-youre-blind">Reading: <em>Stack Overflow: How can you program if you're blind</em></a></p>
    <p>Jonathan Chacón makes one of the more powerful points in this thread when he talks about how it seems that people think more easily about accessibility with respect to end-users but they don’t think about accessibility as a partner and co-developer in the final project. I think that’s a salient point that ought to inform a lot of web development projects. An MVP that is not accessible is simply not an MVP by definition.</p>
    <p>It is besides the point here but interesting to me as a chronic historian—a condition without a cure, truly—that we are slowly arriving at a phase of human history where digital ephemera like webpages, message boards, and other threads, like this question thread on Stack Overflow, feel as if they are part of a cultural heritage that ought to be preserved. It has often been gestured that Fukuyama’s <em>End of History</em>, while not true as an assessment of the state of the world, certainly has power as an ideology, a yearning for a present without memory. An analogy to me would be how problematic it is to adequately develop a history of web design due to the demise of Geocities—or how inadequate a history of social networking would be without a discussion of MySpace and yet how inadequate any attempt to summarize the often modular design of MySpace would be in 2019 and beyond. For a more in-depth exploration on the struggle to capture a history of web design and to archive Geocities, check out “404 Page Not Found” by Kate Wagner: <a href="https://thebaffler.com/salvos/404-page-not-found-wagner">click here to read the article.</a></p>

    <h2>Week 0: Against Normal</h2>
    <p class="source"><a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/on-average/">Reading: <em>On Average</em> by Avery Trufelman</a></p>
    <p>I don’t know if it’s the humanities or what but whenever yet I am basically always suspicious when I hear an appeal to what’s normal. The range and variety of human experience does not conform to the average. ‘Normal’ is a lie, a fable, and the truth of the first cockpits, designed to accommodate the average man, is that the application of what is normal harms and degrades. We might not perceive it that way, but it is so: to bring ‘normal’ to bear on someone or something is to knowingly or unknowingly bludgeon someone outside of the edges and irregularities that make them themselves. </p>
    <p>The story here is also about the misapplication and misunderstanding of statistics and what they claim and what they do not. Quetelet’s application of statistics to social studies is of its time and has yielded many trenchant insights in that field. Statistics make for good performance indicators and can aid analysis, bringing it beyond interpretive faculties that are no more than one guy’s perception of what’s what. However, to apply an average to a world that is irregular, misshapen, and unique misunderstands a descriptive analytic for a predictive one. </p>
    <p>The smarter question asks what arrangements are predictive of success, what designs and organizations are statistically likely to yield successes, and so on. If in usability testing there are a lot of ratings, on scales from 1-5, then that’s probably why. Numbers can be approachable and easily grasped in a way that words and sentences might not.</p>
    <p>I give the article an 8/10.</p>
